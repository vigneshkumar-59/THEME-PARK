      A roller coaster in a theme park is an iconic and exhilarating amusement ride that offers riders a thrilling experience of twists, turns, drops, and loops.<br></br> 
      Typically consisting of a series of tracks and support structures, roller coasters use gravity and mechanical propulsion systems to propel trains of cars along the track at high speeds.<br></br>
      The design of roller coasters can vary widely, with some featuring steep drops for intense acceleration, inversions for upside-down experiences, and helix turns for spiraling excitement.<br></br>
      The unique combination of speed, height, and unexpected twists have an memorable and electrifying experience.
